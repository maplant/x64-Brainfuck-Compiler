A very simple, slightly optimized brainfuck compiler for x64.
Reads from standard input and writes to standard output.

By default, the stack size is set to 60000, which is twice the
size used by the original implementation. This is because, unlike
in the original implementation, the data pointer starts in the
middle, rather than the beginning.

Data is stored in the stack and initialized to 0 at runtime.

Register assignments:
%rdi          - the data pointer.
%rsp and %rbp - stack and base pointers respectively, as per usual.

Commands for assembling and linking output (may vary):
as --64 -o prog.o prog.s
ld -o prog prog.o

Issues:
I suck at assembler of all kinds, so this is all terrible. Joy!
